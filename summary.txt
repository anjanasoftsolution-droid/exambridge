This trajectory chronicles the development of the SOS-Tools application, moving from initial setup to implementing core features, handling user feedback, and performing multiple rounds of bug fixing. The AI engineer started by clarifying user preferences for AI model and database, then proceeded with a bulk file write for the initial React and FastAPI structure. Key challenges involved addressing MongoDB's  serialization issues, optimizing AI prompt for faster generation, and critical bug fixes around PDF generation (multilingual font support, screenshot-based PDFs for non-English), duplicate downloads, and responsive UI. The engineer meticulously addressed each user-reported issue, including the  and  installation issues. The last major implemented feature was integrating Razorpay for subscriptions. The current state is debugging the quiz answer checking logic, as the user reported AI mistakes in evaluating answers within practice mode and provided a PDF for analysis.

The SOS-Tools web application aims to empower students, teachers, and coaching institutes to generate custom, multilingual exam question papers for various Indian exams (NEET, JEE, UPSC, etc.) and practice them online. The platform supports User and Admin roles with email/password authentication, including verification and password reset.

Core functionalities include:
1.  **User Dashboard**: Displays editable profile, generated papers (with download/delete options), online practice access, performance statistics, and free-tier usage with upgrade prompts.
2.  **Question Paper Generator**: A multi-step process for selecting exam type (now includes School Level with grades 1-12, Engineering with streams, and Pharmacy), subject, topics, question types (MCQ, short answer, true/false, essay, reasoning), and paper format (marks, duration, header content). AI (GPT-4o) generates questions, answers, difficulty, multilingual output, and answer keys, with downloadable PDF/HTML. Non-English PDFs are now screenshot-based for proper font rendering.
3.  **Practice Mode**: Online quizzes with one question per screen, option highlighting, instant feedback (correct/wrong answers), score display, and history saving. This mode is now responsive.
4.  **Subscription & Payment**: Free-tier limits (e.g., 1 paper/month, including deleted ones), paid plans, and Razorpay integration for payments, updating user credits and subscription status.
5.  **Admin Console**: Manages users, subscription plans, payments, and monitors usage statistics. Admin credentials are  / .

Recent user feedback highlighted issues with incorrect answer checking in practice mode, duplicate PDF downloads, non-English font visibility in PDFs, and the need for subscription plan management and Razorpay integration. These have been largely addressed, with the answer checking issue still pending a full resolution.

    -   **Importance:** This is the core of the backend, handling all API endpoints for authentication, user management, question paper generation, PDF creation, quiz logic, subscription management, and admin functionalities.
    -   **Changes:** Heavily modified to include:
        -   Authentication endpoints (, , ).
        -   Question generation logic, integrating with LiteLLM (GPT-4o) for diverse question types and multilingual support.
        -   PDF generation functions using  for standard English papers and  for non-English (screenshot-based) PDFs, including font embedding and proper layout.
        -   Endpoints for downloading (paper, answer key) and deleting generated papers.
        -   Quiz submission and scoring logic.
        -   Subscription plans and Razorpay integration (order creation, payment verification).
        -   User model updates for free-tier limits, total papers generated, and roles.
        -   Error handling for MongoDB serialization (ensuring  isn't directly used).
        -   API prompt optimization for faster AI responses.

<pending_tasks>
-   Investigate and fix the answer checking logic in the quiz practice mode, as AI is incorrectly marking some correct answers as wrong (especially for True/False and MCQs).
-   Further develop the Admin Panel to include comprehensive user management (activate/deactivate users, assign plans) and detailed monitoring of usage and statistics.
-   Implement the frontend integration for Razorpay payments and display subscription plans.

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer was immediately engaged in debugging a critical issue reported by the user concerning the online practice mode. The user explicitly stated, please see the pdf here AI making mistake while checking answer and gives wrong for correct answer and provided a PDF artifact for analysis.

The AI engineer acknowledged this, stating, Let me analyze the PDF to see the exact issue with answer checking. This indicates that the current work involves:
1.  **PDF Analysis**: Examining the provided Emergent _ Fullstack App.pdf to understand specific instances where the quiz answer checking mechanism fails, particularly for correct answers being marked as wrong in True/False and MCQ formats.
2.  **Debugging Answer Evaluation**: Identifying the root cause within either the  frontend component (how answers are collected and sent) or, more likely, the  backend endpoint in  (how answers are processed and compared against the AI-generated answer key).

No code changes have been applied in direct response to this latest feedback. The immediate next step is analytical, aimed at pinpointing the precise error in the answer comparison logic before attempting a fix.
